# Visual Studio Workbench Icons 
These icons are my personal icons designed to be used in a visual studio workbench. My use case is a personal knowledge management system (PKM) where these icons make it look more visually appealing 

For instruction on how to use these icons together with the material icons theme [See](customizing-material-icon-theme.md)
